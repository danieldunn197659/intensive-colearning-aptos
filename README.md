# intensive-colearning-aptos

## Project Description

**intensive-colearning-aptos** is an educational and experimental project built around Aptos blockchain technologies. It focuses on co-learning strategies for developing decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts using Move, TypeScript, and related web3 tooling. The project structure suggests a collaborative environment for practical training and prototyping.

## Features

- üìö Co-learning and collaborative development focused on Aptos
- üõ†Ô∏è Example smart contracts written in Move
- üåê Web frontend utilizing TypeScript and JavaScript
- üé® Custom theming support via CSS
- üöÄ Prepared for quick iteration and prototyping

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/danieldunn197659/intensive-colearning-aptos.git
cd intensive-colearning-aptos

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Usage

### Run Development Server

```bash
# Start the local development environment
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### Compile Move Contracts

```bash
# Navigate to the Move package directory and compile
aptos move compile --package-dir move/
```

### Deploy to Aptos Network

```bash
# Publish smart contracts (after configuring aptos profiles)
aptos move publish --package-dir move/ --profile default
```

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Source code for the frontend application
- `theme/`: Custom styles and theming
- `move/` (expected): Smart contracts written in Move
- `book.toml`: Configuration file for documentation (likely mdBook or similar)
